------------

**Controller**
* Ansible version: 2.8+

Usage
=====

Example inventory file

```ini
[ipaserver]
ipaserver.test.local
```

Example playbook to make sure vault is present:

```yaml
---
- name: Playbook to handle vaults
  hosts: ipaserver
  become: true

  tasks:
  - ipavault:
      ipaadmin_password: MyPassword123
      name: symvault
      username: admin
      vault_password: MyVaultPassword123
      description: A standard private vault.
```

Example playbook to make sure that a vault and its members are present:

```yaml
---
- name: Playbook to handle vaults
  hosts: ipaserver
  become: true

  tasks:
  - ipavault:
      ipaadmin_password: MyPassword123
      name: symvault
      username: admin
      users: user01
```

`action` controls if the vault, data, member or owner will be handled. To add or remove members or vault data, set `action` to `member`.

Example playbook to make sure that a vault member is present in vault:

```yaml
---
- name: Playbook to handle vaults
  hosts: ipaserver
  become: true

  tasks:
  - ipavault:
      ipaadmin_password: MyPassword123
      name: symvault
      username: admin
      users: user01
      action: member
```

Example playbook to make sure that a vault owner is absent in vault:

```yaml
---
- name: Playbook to handle vaults
  hosts: ipaserver
  become: true

  tasks:
  - ipavault:
      ipaadmin_password: MyPassword123
      name: symvault
      username: admin
      owner: user01
      action: member
      state: absent
```

Example playbook to make sure vault data is present in a symmetric vault:

```yaml
---
- name: Playbook to handle vaults
  hosts: ipaserver
  become: true

  tasks:
  - ipavault:
      ipaadmin_password: MyPassword123
      name: symvault
      username: admin
      vault_password: MyVaultPassword123
      vault_data: >
        Data archived.
        More data archived.
      action: member
```

Example playbook to make sure vault data is absent in a symmetric vault:

```yaml
---
- name: Playbook to handle vaults
  hosts: ipaserver
  become: true

  tasks:
  - ipavault:
      ipaadmin_password: MyPassword123
      name: symvault
      username: admin
      vault_password: MyVaultPassword123
      action: member
      state: absent
```

Example playbook to make sure vault is absent:

```yaml
---
- name: Playbook to handle vaults
  hosts: ipaserver
  become: true

  tasks:
  - ipavault:
      ipaadmin_password: MyPassword123
      name: symvault
      username: admin
      state: absent
```
